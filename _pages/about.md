I am a forth-year PhD candidate in Data Science and Analytics, Division of Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas, HKUST. My reserach interest is efficient machine learning, including continual learning on different data modalities and efficient automated machine learning. I am supervised by Prof. CHEN, Lei and Prof. YANG, Qiang. Prior to my PhD study, I received my B.Sc. degree in Honors Physics and Computer Science from HKUST in 2021.
